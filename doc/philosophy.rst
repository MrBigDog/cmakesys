Philosophy
==========
- Add macros,variables, and controls for functionality that has been proven
  useful in multiple projects.
- Do not interfere or inhibit use of standard cmake scripting; i.e., "tools, not rules".
- Pick and choose (if you know you'll never use doxygen, simply don't invoke
  the smakesys doxygen macro. No harm done.)
- Simple example projects to demonstrate usage.
